# healthypeopleApp
This project is designed to be a healthcare software package for use in hospitals and among patients
Idea: Design an all-in-one healthcare package that can be used by hospitals 
Functions:
 Health tracking by users from popular fitness apps
 Doctors can see updated health stats from fitness trackers, medical history, and vital measurements taken at an office visit or hospital visit.
 Application will be able to send fitness data to merge with medical records for the patient's health profile
 Doctors can use all of this information to make informed health recommendations to patients or diagnose illnesses based on testing done and existing information in the patient's health profile.
 The application can  bill insurance and send a billing statement to the patient for services performed during the office/hospital visit.
 All data will be secure to HIPPA Compliance standards and will be encrypted with AES grade encryption for patient protection.
 Patients will have access to view  their health profile after initial account setup with transfer of medical records and  modify contact information or setup fitness tracking devices with accounts linked to Google Fit, Samsung Health, Fitbit, or Apple Health.
 
In this application solution you will find several components:

A database that contains all tables related to the functionality of the program.
A server-side application that can run for the hospital/doctor's office side of things.
A client side app for users to login to work with patient data
A mobile app for doctors to do their jobs and mobile app for patients to take advantage of the services this system provides
